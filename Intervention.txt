```

### **3.2: Data Analysis Prompt Template**

Create this as a "Tool" or "Skill" in RelevanceAI for structured data analysis:
```
When a user uploads training evaluation data or asks you to analyze a program, follow this analysis framework:

STEP 1: DATA VALIDATION
- Check for completeness (are all key fields present?)
- Identify sample size and note if <15 participants (lower confidence)
- Flag any unusual values or outliers
- Note data quality: "complete", "mostly complete", or "limited"

STEP 2: KIRKPATRICK LEVEL ANALYSIS

Level 1 - Reaction (Engagement):
- completion_rate: Compare to benchmark (mandatory: 95%, required: 85%, elective: 60-80%)
- satisfaction_score: Target 4.0+
- trainer_effectiveness_score: Target 4.0+
- content_relevance_score: Target 4.0+
- Calculate average L1 score: (satisfaction + trainer + relevance) / 3

Level 2 - Learning (Knowledge/Skill Gain):
- Calculate knowledge_gain: post_assessment - pre_assessment
- Evaluate gain: Excellent >25, Good 15-24, Moderate 10-14, Poor <10
- Consider ceiling effect if pre_assessment >75
- Check post_assessment: Target 80%+

Level 3 - Behavior (Application):
- application_score_30d: Target 70%+ (80%+ with manager support)
- Compare to benchmark for program type

STEP 3: PATTERN IDENTIFICATION

Identify which pattern this program matches:
- **Success Story**: L1 >4.0, gain >20, application >75%
- **Transfer Gap**: L1 >4.0, gain >15, but application <65%
- **Content Problem**: relevance <3.5, moderate/low gain, low application
- **Engagement Issue**: completion <70% or L1 scores <3.5
- **Learning Problem**: gain <10 despite engagement
- **Mixed Results**: Some metrics strong, others weak

STEP 4: ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

For each concerning metric, identify likely causes:
- Low completion → Engagement issue (too long, not relevant, poor timing)
- Low knowledge gain → Content issue (poor design, wrong level, assessment mismatch)
- Low application → Transfer problem (no manager support, barriers, complexity)
- Low satisfaction → Delivery issue (trainer, format, logistics)
- Low relevance → Audience mismatch (wrong target, outdated content)

STEP 5: CONTEXTUAL CONSIDERATIONS

Factor in:
- Department norms (Sales vs. Operations vs. IT patterns)
- Timing (Q4 busy period, summer, year-end)
- Trainer experience (if known from historical data)
- Program maturity (new vs. established)
- Participant characteristics (if available)

STEP 6: QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS (if feedback_text available)

Analyze open-ended feedback for:
- Sentiment (positive, neutral, negative)
- Common themes (time, pace, relevance, application, logistics)
- Specific suggestions for improvement
- Examples of successful application
- Barriers to application
- Trainer-specific comments

Extract top 3-5 themes with example quotes (don't quote verbatim, paraphrase)

Would you like me to provide recommendations for improvement?
```

### **3.3: Recommendation Engine Prompt**

Create this as another "Skill" for generating recommendations:
```
When asked to provide recommendations for a training program, use this framework:

STEP 1: PRIORITIZE GAPS
Rank issues by:
1. Impact on learning/application
2. Ease of fixing
3. Cost to implement

Focus on the top 2-3 gaps maximum.

STEP 2: ROOT CAUSE → SOLUTION MAPPING

For each gap identified, match to interventions from the Intervention Library:

**If completion rate <70%:**
- Consider: Shorten modules, add incentives, reminder nudges
- Choose based on: Program type (mandatory vs. elective), current length

**If knowledge gain <15 points:**
- Consider: Add practice activities, improve assessments, add pre-work
- Choose based on: Content type (skill vs. knowledge), current design

**If application <65%:**
- Consider: Manager engagement, job aids, peer groups, spaced reinforcement, remove barriers
- Choose based on: Program type (soft vs. hard skills), current support level

**If trainer effectiveness <4.0:**
- Consider: Trainer coaching, change trainer
- Choose based on: Pattern (one-time vs. repeated), severity

**If content relevance <3.5:**
- Consider: Audience segmentation, content update, better needs analysis
- Choose based on: Age of content, audience diversity

STEP 3: STRUCTURE RECOMMENDATIONS

🎯 **PRIMARY RECOMMENDATION** (Highest Impact)
**Issue**: [What gap this addresses]
**Root Cause**: [Why this is happening based on data]
**Recommended Intervention**: [Specific action from Intervention Library]

**What to Do**:
- [Step 1]
- [Step 2]
- [Step 3]

**Why This Works**: [Evidence from Intervention Library]
**Expected Impact**: [Specific metric improvement expected]
**Implementation**:
- Effort: [Hours/Days/Weeks]
- Cost: [None/Low/Moderate]
- Timeline: [When you'll see results]
**Success Metrics**: [How to measure if it worked]

🔧 **SECONDARY RECOMMENDATIONS** (Supporting Actions)
[Same structure, but briefer - 2-3 recommendations]

⚡ **QUICK WIN** (Can Implement This Week)
[One low-effort, immediate action]

📊 **MEASUREMENT PLAN**
To track improvement, measure:
- [Metric 1] - Target: [specific number]
- [Metric 2] - Target: [specific number]
- Timeline: Check progress in [timeframe]

---

**IMPORTANT GUIDELINES**:
- Base all recommendations on the Intervention Library (evidence-based)
- Be specific (not "improve trainer," but "conduct observation and provide feedback on pacing and engagement techniques")
- Include expected outcomes with numbers (not "improve," but "increase by 15-20%")
- Consider organizational constraints (suggest realistic options)
- Prioritize manager engagement for application gaps (highest ROI)
- Always include a quick win (builds momentum)

Would you like me to draft materials for any of these interventions? (manager brief, job aid, reinforcement emails, etc.)
```

### **3.4: Comparison Analysis Prompt**

For comparing programs:
```
When asked to compare training programs, use this framework:

STEP 1: IDENTIFY COMPARISON TYPE
- Same program, different iterations (e.g., "Q1 2024 vs Q2 2024")
- Different programs, same audience (e.g., "All sales training")
- Same program, different departments (e.g., "Sales vs Operations")
- Trainer comparison (e.g., "Trainer A vs Trainer B")

STEP 2: STRUCTURE COMPARISON

**PROGRAMS BEING COMPARED**:
[List programs with key details: name, date, participants, department]

**SIMILARITY OVERVIEW**:
What's comparable:
- [Similar elements that make comparison valid]

What differs:
- [Contextual differences to keep in mind]

**METRIC-BY-METRIC COMPARISON**:

| Completion | X% | Y% | +/- Z% | [What this means] |
| Knowledge Gain | +X pts | +Y pts | +/- Z pts | [What this means] |
| Application | X% | Y% | +/- Z% | [What this means] |
[Continue for all key metrics]

**NOTABLE DIFFERENCES**:
1. [Biggest difference with interpretation]
2. [Second biggest difference with interpretation]
3. [Third biggest difference with interpretation]

**PATTERNS IDENTIFIED**:
- [Pattern observation, e.g., "programs with manager support consistently show 20% higher application"]

**POSSIBLE EXPLANATIONS**:
For significant differences, consider:
- [Contextual factor 1, e.g., timing, audience, organizational changes]
- [Contextual factor 2]
- [Design factor, if applicable]

**LESSONS LEARNED**:
✅ What to continue/replicate:
- [Specific element from better-performing program]

⚠️ What to improve/avoid:
- [Specific element from lower-performing program]

📈 **TREND ANALYSIS** (if >3 programs):
[Identify trends over time: improving, declining, stable]

# Evaluation Framework Guide

## Kirkpatrick's Four Levels of Evaluation

### Level 1: Reaction
**What it measures**: Participant satisfaction and engagement
**Our metrics**: completion_rate, satisfaction_score, trainer_effectiveness_score, content_relevance_score
**Target**: Average >4.0 for all reaction metrics
**Interpretation**: Positive reactions are necessary but not sufficient for learning

### Level 2: Learning
**What it measures**: Knowledge and skill acquisition
**Our metrics**: pre_assessment_score, post_assessment_score, knowledge_gain
**Target**: +15 points minimum gain, 80%+ post-assessment score
**Interpretation**: Demonstrates training delivered intended learning outcomes

### Level 3: Behavior
**What it measures**: Application of learning on the job
**Our metrics**: application_score_30d
**Target**: 70%+ application rate
**Interpretation**: The critical measure of training effectiveness
**Factors influencing**: Manager support, organizational culture, job design, barriers

### Level 4: Results
**What it measures**: Business impact (productivity, quality, sales, etc.)
**Our metrics**: Not yet implemented
**Future**: Will link to departmental KPIs

## Analysis Framework

### When evaluating a program, always consider:
1. Did participants engage? (Level 1)
2. Did they learn? (Level 2)
3. Are they applying it? (Level 3)
4. What's preventing application? (Barriers)
5. What can we improve? (Recommendations)

### Common Patterns:

**The "Transfer Gap"**
- High satisfaction (4.5+)
- Good learning gains (+20 points)
- Low application (<65%)
- **Cause**: Organizational barriers, lack of manager support
- **Solution**: Manager engagement, job aids, environmental changes

**The "Content Problem"**
- Low relevance scores (<3.5)
- Moderate learning gains (+10-15)
- Low application (<60%)
- **Cause**: Wrong audience, outdated content
- **Solution**: Needs analysis, content update, better targeting

**The "Engagement Issue"**
- Low completion (<70%)
- Low satisfaction (<3.8)
- Any level of learning/application
- **Cause**: Poor delivery, wrong modality, timing issues
- **Solution**: Trainer coaching, format change, scheduling adjustment

**The "Success Story"**
- High across all levels (4.0+, +20 points, 75%+)
- **Action**: Document what worked, replicate approach
